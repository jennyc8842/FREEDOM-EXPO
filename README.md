<b>Context</b>

The purpose of “Freedom Project” for SEP10 is a year long project that the 10th graders are doing to research about a topic of their choice in what is in the requirement lists. They will apply the information they’re learning  from their lessons (Github, HTML, CSS, and the Command Line), research the information on their own, reflecting it in a blog and presenting their work to others and the steps. The purpose of this blog is the process of making my website, what I have incorporated in my website based on what I have learned in class, and my research about virtual reality, specifically on the top 4 headsets, the basics of VR, and the uses of VR. In the blogs, I will list the things I have learned so far to incorporate into my FP website and make it look more eye-catching and interesting to read about.

<b>Content</b>

For my project, I am making a website about Virtual Reality using Github, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying Virtual Reality and the subtopics I have chosen (the top 4 headsets, the basics of VR, and the uses of VR) and making the website.

<b>Implications</b>

The implication of this website is that because at this moment in time we are dealing with the COVID-19 crisis and it's a great time to be learning a new skill in VR. A lot of teens and adults use them to learn new skills, for video games, or to see a 3 dimensional version of one of the most beautiful places on Earth! Here you will learn the basics of VR, the best top 4 VR headsets, and what are the uses for them. Based on someone’s understanding of the topic, people can learn that virtual reality is very beneficial and that they should try it as well. They can learn many certain skills like the ones listed above. 

In addition, when researching about a topic, there are always possible positive and negative implications to consider. I believe that virtual reality will mostly have a positive impact on jobs, to certain individuals and our educational system. (economic, social, and global effects) 

One way virtual reality will impact us are our jobs. Virtual reality is able to prepare us for our future jobs that we would like to do. People can gain skills for a specific area they’re struggling on, or things that they are motivated to learn. For example, VR has great benefits for the military. VR can set a person that is training for the military in many possible situations, places and environments they might come across. This can include situations on the battlefield, medic training, boot camp, vehicle problems and more. However, the main benefit of using VR in the military is that it reduces the amount of money used for training and no one will actually get hurt during hazardous trainings which may take them many months, or even years to heal. 

Another way virtual reality will impact certain individuals. These individuals may include those who have a hard time communicating socially with others (ex: autism). Because of this, these people have the tendency to have a hard time making friends and fitting into society. However, ever since the mid 1990s, therapists have been using VR to help out with the situation. The reason behind this is so they can help these specific people prepare for encounters that may seem difficult. This includes them to be able to develop social and emotional skills that can help them in school, or work. In addition, because of VR, these individuals will have a better interaction with others and less frustration when they encounter a situation. However, parents argue that people with social difficulties that are using VR, suggests that the person is not normal due to their disorder. It is saying that they have to change in order to fit in. Because of this, parents say that using VR is wrong and abusive. 

Lastly, virtual reality will impact the education system. Virtual reality are great for students who have a have a hard time understanding the teacher word by word. Instead, they need to learn things visually. This makes VR in handle. VR are able to allow the students learn by seeing images of what their teachers are trying to interpret. This makes visual learners able to understand what is going on and may enhance their learning experience. For example, they can take on virtual field trips to the museums to learn about the solar system, or the Milky Way.
